# Slicer Profiles

## Purpose
To backup and version control the various 3D Printer slicer profiles that I am using


### PursaSlicer
There is an export options for config and config_bundle. I am exporting both. Right now, I am going with very generic names for each until I have a better understanding of what I am exporting or until a need arises for different names.
